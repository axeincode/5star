For example, a bet might be offered mistakenly at a price that is substantially out of the market, or 'each way' is offered in a market when the pricing of the market clearly indicates that it should have been 'win only', or a promotion designed to offer a €5 return might mistakenly advertise a €50 return or the pay-tables advertised for a product may mistakenly fail to reflect the true payment configuration of the product.",
